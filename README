Introduction
------------

nsperl2 is an AOLServer module which bridges, in both directions, between tcl and Perl.

With it you can:
  * call perl functions from tcl (via the perl::call tcl function)
  * call tcl functions from perl (via a number of methods - see Documentation below)
  * register perl functions to handle aolserver requests (via Ns::register_url)

Downloading
-----------

See INSTALL.txt for the versions of perl, tcl and aolserver you will need.

The latest version of nsperl2 is always avalible via subversion. See Links below.

Installation
------------

As you can imagine, it is not a walk in the park to correctly link tcl, aolserver and perl.
While there will be many ways of making it all work, you are best off following the step by
step instructions in INSTALL.txt at least at first. It details the versions and options
of each part.

Once the tcl, aolserver and perl pre-requisites are installed, the nsperl2
Makefile builds the api modules and links everything together for you.

A set of tests is also included, although they do not yet cover every documented method.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation can be found in the perl modules' pod. The test cases are also useful
documentation.

You can browse the pod of the latest svn trunk versions online.
