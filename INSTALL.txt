I am not entirely sure yet what are the minimum supported versions of Tcl/Aolserver etc., and what
flexibility you have with perl compilation options (although perl 5.10 is almost definately required).

For now, here is exactly what I did to install - my tested configurations are listed below

#
# Setup install directory & env variables
#
# I put tcl and aolserver in the same root, but you
# probably don't need to.
#
# I always run the test suites - some people skip them.
#
# be careful of any existing LIBS, CINCLUDES  etc. env variables - I had them set for
# MacPorts and it caused problems getting aolserver to link to my new tcl
#


    export NSSRC=~/aol/aolserver-4.5.0    # aolserver src tree (need to get to nsd.h)
    export NSINST=/opt/aolserver-test     # where aolserver is going to be installed
    export TCLINST=/opt/aolserver-test    # where tcl is going to be installed
    export NSPERLINST=/opt/aolserver-perl # where perl & modules are going to be installed
    export NSPERL=$NSPERLINST/bin/perl     # path to the perl binary

    sudo mkdir $NSINST
    sudo mkdir $TCLINST
    sudo mkdir $NSPERLINST
    sudo chown aufflick $NSINST $TCLINST $NSPERLINST # use the appropriate user here

# MacOS X specific
#
# You also need to do the following on 10.5 if you use aolserver 4.5.0 (instead of HEAD).
# I know, it seems to make no sense, but you need to, else you get seg faults.
# See: http://www.mail-archive.com/aolserver@listserv.aol.com/msg11339.html

#
# Install tcl
#
# you may be able to use a suitable existing installation
# note the corefoundation caveat for Mac installs below
#

    tar zxf tcl8.4.18-src.tar.gz
    cd tcl8.4.18/unix

# for Mac OS X:
# (the disable-corefoundation is required otherwise any forks in perl code will be unsafe)
    ./configure --enable-threads --disable-corefoundation --prefix=$TCLINST

# for Centos 4.5 (Linux): [Note 1]
    cat configure | | sed 's/-lieee//' > configure.noieee
    sh configure.noieee --enable-threads --prefix=$TCLINST

    make
    make test      # I get an odd clock failure on both platforms [Note 2]
    make install
    cd ../..

#
# Install Aolserver
#

    tar zxf aolserver-4.5.0-src.tar.gz
    cd aolserver-4.5.0

    $TCLINST/bin/tclsh8.4 nsconfig.tcl -install $NSINST

# For MacOS:
    make
    make install

# For Centos 4.5 (Linux): [Note 3]
    CFLAGS=-nostartfiles make
    CFLAGS=-nostartfiles make install

    cd ..

#
# Install perl
#

    tar zxf perl-5.10.0.tar.gz
    cd perl-5.10.0

# omit the -d on the end if you want interactive configuration prompts instead of defaults

    sh Configure -Dprefix=$NSPERLINST -Dusethreads -Dusemultiplicity -d

    make
    make test     # these tests take a long time
    make install

#
# Install perl module required for nsperl2 tests
#
# the CPAN shell will ask you all sorts of questions - mostly the defaults are fine.
# it won't ask you again if you install more modules later.
#

   $NSPERL -MCPAN -e'install "LWP"'

#
# Install nsperl2
#

    cd ..
    svn co http://svn.pumptheory.com/repos/trunk/aolserver/nsperl2
    cd nsperl2
    # see MacOS X note below
    make install
    make test

# note that 'make test' starts an nsd server on port 
# MacOS X note - with aolserver 4.5.0 you seem to need to do the following due to a bug in the
# build process:

    cd nsperl2; make; cd ..


Tested Configurations
---------------------

O/S                            Tcl     Perl  Aolserver                 gcc
------------------------------ ------- ----- ------------------------- -------------------------------
Mac OS X 10.5 (PPC)            8.4.18  5.10  cvs (HEAD at 2008-03-22)  powerpc-apple-darwin9-gcc-4.0.1
Mac OS X 10.5 (PPC)            8.4.18  5.10  4.5.0                     powerpc-apple-darwin9-gcc-4.0.1
CentOS 4.5 (Intel 32 bit SMP)  8.4.18  5.10  4.5.0                     3.4.6 20060404 (Red Hat 3.4.6-9)


Notes
-----

1. Tcl always compiles against libieee on Linux. This is not needed with newish glibc
   and causes a link error when nsperl2 links perl with tcl. On Linux (and perhaps other platforms)
   you must currently remove -lieee from configure so it doesn't get into the Makefile or the tclConfig.sh

   Someone from RedHat seems to agree -lieee is unnecessary:
     http://rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/redhat/enterprise/4/x86_64/src/tcl-8.4.7-2.src.html


2. I get the following tcl make test failure on both MacOS X 10.5 and Centos 4.5:

   ==== clock-8.1 clock scan midnight/gmt range bug 413397 FAILED
   ==== Contents of test case:
   
       set fmt "%m/%d"
       list [clock format [clock scan year -base $5amPST -gmt 0] -format $fmt]  [clock format [clock scan year -base $5amPST -gmt 1] -format $fmt]
   
   ---- Result was:
   01/01 01/01
   ---- Result should have been (exact matching):
   12/31 12/31
   ==== clock-8.1 FAILED


3. Unsure if the -nostartflags is unnecessary on MacOS X because of the newer gcc or the
   Darwin libtool. Newer Linux installations or other Unix flavours may vary.
